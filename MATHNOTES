proposition is a declaration 

True = 1 or True

Not Propositions

Not True not false

A. Giving commands, cant tell if true or false

B. Distance from location to location

C. X + 2 = 3x (No x value)


Terminologies

				Symbol				Meaning

Negation				~					Not
Conjunction				^					and
Disjunction				v					or
Conditional 			->					if/then
Biconditional			<->					if and only if


Truth Table ----

P 			Q





Related Conditionals

Converse = reverse p -> Q

contrapositive 

negation of q -> negation of p

inverse of conditional is negation of p -> negation of q

-ex- 

p = given number is divisible by 6

q = given number is divisible by 3

interchange it q -> p

if the given number is divisible by 3 then the gievn number is divisible by 6

contrapositive

p = given number is divisible by 6

q = given number is divisible by 3

if the given number is not divisible by 3 then the given number is not divisible by 6


inverse:

p = given numbewr is divisible by 6

q = given number is divisible by 3

if the givvevn number is not divvisible by 6 then the gien number is not divisible by

2. conjunction of P and Q

Conjunction = "and" operator

written as P ^ Q


Disjunction 

"or" operator

P v Q

Inclusive or == one false = true. both false == false

exclusive or == Has to be all true to be true, one false = false. 
	ex: P + Q
	

implication or conditional

"if - then" or "implies"

	P -> Q 
p = hypothesis. Q = conclusion

"If P, then Q"
	"Q if P"



HOWEVER. If hypothesis is false/unsatisfied, it will always be true. due to it being a hypothesis

BICONDITIONAl

"IF AND ONLY IF"

	P <=> Q 
		P is equivalent to Q

T<=> T == T
T<=> F == F
F<=> T == F 
F<=> F == T

Types of proposition

Tautology -> always true
Contradiction -> always false

Deductive Arguments

	Collection of propositions where one of the propositions(conclusion) follows from the previous proposition(premise)
	
	ex: P1										-
	    P2										|
	    .		Assuming all is true						|
	    .										|
	    .										|	------> Propositional form
	    Pn										|
	    --										|
	    .*.C -> must also be true			# .*. = therefore		|
	   
if true implies true, then the conclusion must be true

	ex: P1:If today is sunny, then today is humid (1st premise)
	    P2:Today is not humid.
	    C: Therefore, today is not sunny. #tentative lol had to go to work
	  				#p1 and p2 = premises. C = conclusion
					
	   Premises: A:Today is sunny.
	   	     B:Today is humid.
		     
		     
		     
Tautology syntax = Within a truth table if there is a false it becomes nullified and therefore doesn't become a tautology. 
			Formula : T -> F = F

Rules of Inference 
1. Addition 
P1: P
C: .*. P v Q				#if you are confused with the symbols, scroll back up into the symbol cheatsheet :)) 

2. Simplification 
	P1: P ^ Q 			P ^ Q 				Q^P 			Q^P
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	C: .*. P 			.*. Q 				.*.Q			.*.P]
				
				P^Q -> P
			T t	T	T	T
			T f	F	T	T
			F f	T	T	F
			F f	T	T	F
			
3. Conjunction 
	p1: P					(P1 ^ P2) => C
	P2: Q							\
	ci: p^Q					(P^Q) =>	(P^Q)
						
4. Modus Ponens

	P1: 	P=>Q				[(P=>Q)^P ] = Q
	P2: 	P				
	-------------
	c: .*. Q
	
5. Disjunctive Syllogism
P1: P v Q				[(P v Q) ^ ~P] -> Q
P2: ~P					T   T	T	 
----------				T   T	F	
C: .*. Q				F   T	T	
					F   F	F	
					
#6-7 i looked at my phone mb will add

8. Constructive Dilemma
p1: (p=>q) ^ (R=>S)
p2: P v R
C:.*. Q V S
9. Destructivve Dilema
