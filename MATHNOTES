Not Propositions

Not True not false

A. Giving commands, cant tell if true or false

B. Distance from location to location

C. X + 2 = 3x (No x value)

P 			Q





Related Conditionals

Converse = reverse p -> Q

contrapositive 

negation of q -> negation of p

inverse of conditional is negation of p -> negation of q

-ex- 

p = given number is divisible by 6

q = given number is divisible by 3

interchange it q -> p

if the given number is divisible by 3 then the gievn number is divisible by 6

contrapositive

p = given number is divisible by 6

q = given number is divisible by 3

if the given number is not divisible by 3 then the given number is not divisible by 6


inverse:

p = given numbewr is divisible by 6

q = given number is divisible by 3

if the givvevn number is not divvisible by 6 then the gien number is not divisible by
