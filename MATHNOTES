### 24/03/22 SYNC NOTES

proposition is a declaration 

True = 1 or True

Not Propositions

Not True not false

A. Giving commands, cant tell if true or false

B. Distance from location to location

C. X + 2 = 3x (No x value)


Terminologies

				Symbol				Meaning

Negation				~					Not
Conjunction				^					and
Disjunction				v					or
Conditional 			->					if/then
Biconditional			<->					if and only if


Truth Table ----

P 			Q





Related Conditionals

Converse = reverse p -> Q

contrapositive 

negation of q -> negation of p

inverse of conditional is negation of p -> negation of q

-ex- 

p = given number is divisible by 6

q = given number is divisible by 3

interchange it q -> p

if the given number is divisible by 3 then the gievn number is divisible by 6

contrapositive

p = given number is divisible by 6

q = given number is divisible by 3

if the given number is not divisible by 3 then the given number is not divisible by 6


inverse:

p = given numbewr is divisible by 6

q = given number is divisible by 3

if the givvevn number is not divvisible by 6 then the gien number is not divisible by

2. conjunction of P and Q

Conjunction = "and" operator

written as P ^ Q


Disjunction 

"or" operator

P v Q

Inclusive or == one false = true. both false == false

exclusive or == Has to be all true to be true, one false = false. 
	ex: P + Q
	

implication or conditional

"if - then" or "implies"

	P -> Q 
p = hypothesis. Q = conclusion

"If P, then Q"
	"Q if P"



HOWEVER. If hypothesis is false/unsatisfied, it will always be true. due to it being a hypothesis

BICONDITIONAl

"IF AND ONLY IF"

	P <=> Q 
		P is equivalent to Q

T<=> T == T
T<=> F == F
F<=> T == F 
F<=> F == T

Types of proposition

Tautology -> always true
Contradiction -> always false
