proposition is a declaration 

True = 1 or True

Not Propositions

Not True not false

A. Giving commands, cant tell if true or false

B. Distance from location to location

C. X + 2 = 3x (No x value)


Terminologies

				Symbol				Meaning

Negation				~					Not
Conjunction				^					and
Disjunction				v					or
Conditional 			->					if/then
Biconditional			<->					if and only if


Truth Table ----

P 			Q





Related Conditionals

Converse = reverse p -> Q

contrapositive 

negation of q -> negation of p

inverse of conditional is negation of p -> negation of q

-ex- 

p = given number is divisible by 6

q = given number is divisible by 3

interchange it q -> p

if the given number is divisible by 3 then the gievn number is divisible by 6

contrapositive

p = given number is divisible by 6

q = given number is divisible by 3

if the given number is not divisible by 3 then the given number is not divisible by 6


inverse:

p = given numbewr is divisible by 6

q = given number is divisible by 3

if the givvevn number is not divvisible by 6 then the gien number is not divisible by

2. conjunction of P and Q

Conjunction = "and" operator

written as P ^ Q


Disjunction 

"or" operator

P v Q

Inclusive or == one false = true. both false == false

exclusive or == Has to be all true to be true, one false = false. 
	ex: P + Q
	

implication or conditional

"if - then" or "implies"

	P -> Q 
p = hypothesis. Q = conclusion

"If P, then Q"
	"Q if P"



HOWEVER. If hypothesis is false/unsatisfied, it will always be true. due to it being a hypothesis

BICONDITIONAl

"IF AND ONLY IF"

	P <=> Q 
		P is equivalent to Q

T<=> T == T
T<=> F == F
F<=> T == F 
F<=> F == T

Types of proposition

Tautology -> always true
Contradiction -> always false

Deductive Arguments

	Collection of propositions where one of the propositions(conclusion) follows from the previous proposition(premise)
	
	ex: P1										-
	    P2										|
	    .		Assuming all is true						|
	    .										|
	    .										|	------> Propositional form
	    Pn										|
	    --										|
	    .*.C -> must also be true			# .*. = therefore		|
	   
if true implies true, then the conclusion must be true

	ex: P1:If today is sunny, then today is humid (1st premise)
	    P2:Today is not humid.
	    C: Therefore, today is not sunny. #tentative lol had to go to work
	  				#p1 and p2 = premises. C = conclusion
					
	   Premises: A:Today is sunny.
	   	     B:Today is humid.
		     
		     
		     
Tautology syntax = Within a truth table if there is a false it becomes nullified and therefore doesn't become a tautology. 
			Formula : T -> F = F

Rules of Inference 
1. Addition 
P1: P
C: .*. P v Q				#if you are confused with the symbols, scroll back up into the symbol cheatsheet :)) 

2. Simplification 
	P1: P ^ Q 			P ^ Q 				Q^P 			Q^P
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	C: .*. P 			.*. Q 				.*.Q			.*.P]
				
				P^Q -> P
			T t	T	T	T
			T f	F	T	T
			F f	T	T	F
			F f	T	T	F
			
3. Conjunction 
	p1: P					(P1 ^ P2) => C
	P2: Q							\
	ci: p^Q					(P^Q) =>	(P^Q)
						
4. Modus Ponens

	P1: 	P=>Q				[(P=>Q)^P ] = Q
	P2: 	P				
	-------------
	c: .*. Q
	
5. Disjunctive Syllogism
P1: P v Q				[(P v Q) ^ ~P] -> Q
P2: ~P					T   T	T	 
----------				T   T	F	
C: .*. Q				F   T	T	
					F   F	F	
					
#6-7 i looked at my phone mb will add

8. Constructive Dilemma
p1: (p=>q) ^ (R=>S)
p2: P v R
C:.*. Q V S

INVESTMENTS

Simple interest
	- Simple interest is when the interest rate is fixed over a period over time
	
	I = Prt		(I = interest) (P = principal amount) (r is rate in decimal form) (t is time)
	
	F = P + I = P(1 + rt)       ( F = Future value or maturity value)
	
	

Compound Interest 
	- Compound interest earns interest not only on the principal but also on the interest earned in the prior period
	
	Formula: F = P(1+ r/m)^mt  		(P = principal) (r = rate per year(decimal)) (t = time (year)) (m = number of times interest is compounded)
	
	
anually -> m = 1 
semi ->  m = 2
quarterly -> m = 4
monthly -> m= 12 


Savings Account:
	store money securely while earning interest

	1. you can deposit and withdraw cash anytime
	2. bank pays you interest on the money you leave in your account
	3. money is insured up to 500,000 through the Philippine deposit Insurance corporation
	4. Various types of savings account (depending on the initial deposit, ADB and earning interest)
	

Time Deposit: 
	Certificate of deposit in a bank product almost the same as a saving account. With time deposit account, your money will be kept by the bank for a fixed 
	period of time for an interest rate higher than the savings account 
	
	terminating a time deposit account before the maturity date will result to a penalty from the bank. 
	80% of money goes to us, 20% goes to the bank.
	

Several Regular Payments:
	 An annuity is a sequence of  equal payments made regularly
	 The amount of each payment is referred as the regular payment, denoted by r
